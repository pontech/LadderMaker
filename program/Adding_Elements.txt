to add element: (incomplete)

    Make 2 Icons:
        Need two Icons, in SVG.  One for the button with a white background,
        and one with background only in the center.  See templates in icon folder
    
    Add a button to toolbar:
        Add button to UI with QT designer.  Create an new action, and drag it to the toolbar. set icon. (first add icon with resource editor)
        remember to compile all UI files
    
    Add element: 
        to list in "clsss elementList" in "Main.py"  This defines pretty much everything that the element is.
    
    Add tool to actiongroup, and connect:
        in "def signalConnections(self)"    in "Main.py" (examples):
         
        toolActionGroup.addAction(self.ui.actionContNO) <--example ContNO
        
        self.connect(self.ui.actionContNO, QtCore.SIGNAL("triggered()"),lambda who=1: self.anyButton(who))
    
    Add it to a popup:
        in "def runPopup(self, tool, cellNum)" in "Main.py"
            add it as an "and" to an existing popup 
        Or create a new popup  and add it to "popupsDialog.py") and to "runPopup"
        
    If it is a edit tool: 
        
    give it a function in manageGrid "managegrid.py"
    give it an elif in showMarker in "Main.py"
    call that function apropriatly in leftClick function  in "Main.py"
